Thanks for checking out my menu!
About:
(GTQ)UwU Menu makes finding and installing the latest mods just a bit easier by placing all the latest (aprroved) mods in one place!
The menu is going to be continuously updated so make sure to check for the latest version otherwise the downloads might not work.

Installation:
 1.Click on the UwUMenu.exe file above
 
 2.Press the download button
 
 3.Once installed run the exe
 
 4. You will get a warning, click "more info" then "run anyway"
 
 5.Congratulations you now have the latest version of (GorillaTag for Quest) UwUMenu Installed!

(DISCLAMER: I do not own any of the mods listed in this menu, They are credited inside the menu)

If you are the creator of any file listed inside of the menu and want it removed please email me at jdrice5250@gmail.com and list the subject as Gorilla tag (Just so it doesn't end up in my trash)
